# Project Brief: lenakeke.github.io

This project is a personal website dedicated to sharing guided readings of technical articles found online. It aims to break down complex topics and provide summaries or interpretations to help others learn.

## Core Requirements

- A collection of pages, each dedicated to a specific technical article.
- A main `index.html` that serves as a homepage, listing the available article guides.
- The `sharing/` directory will contain the individual HTML files for each article guide.
- Styling is managed through a central `style.css`.
- `pages.json` likely defines the list of articles and their metadata (e.g., title, link to original article, path to the local guide page).
