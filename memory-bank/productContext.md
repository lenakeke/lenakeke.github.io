# Product Context

This website is designed to be an educational resource, making complex technical articles more accessible to a broader audience.

## Problem Solved

Many insightful technical articles are long, dense, or assume a high level of prior knowledge. This site solves that problem by providing "guided readings" â€“ summaries, explanations of key concepts, and context that make the material easier to digest. It helps users save time and learn more effectively.

## User Experience

- **Readability:** The primary focus is on clear, legible text and a layout that supports long-form reading.
- **Guidance:** Each guide should clearly link to the original article and provide a structured walkthrough.
- **Discoverability:** Users should be able to easily browse and find articles they are interested in.
